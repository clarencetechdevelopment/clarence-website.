        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
      <p>Hey! I'm Clarence kago I’m 14 years old, and I’m super passionate about technology, gaming, and learning new things. I created this website to showcase my coding journey and share some of the things I love with the world.</p>     
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm always learning new things and exploring the world of web development. My goal is to keep building websites, learn new programming languages, and eventually share my journey with others through a YouTube channel.</p>
        
       
 

    <p>Here’s a little more about me:</p>
    
    <h3>My Interests & Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coding:</strong> I started coding at a young age, and I just fell in love with it! Making websites, apps, and games is so much fun, and there’s always something new to learn. I mostly work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right now, but I’m always curious to explore other languages like Python and Java.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing video games. My favorite games include <strong>Minecraft</strong>, <strong>Fortnite</strong>, and <strong>Roblox</strong>. I enjoy connecting with friends and exploring new worlds or building creative structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Music:</strong> I love listening to music, especially **pop**, **hip-hop**, and **EDM**. Music helps me stay focused while working, and I also love discovering new artists and genres!</li>
        <li><strong>Drawing & Creativity:</strong> I’m not just a tech enthusiast—I also love drawing! I like sketching characters, scenes, and anything that inspires me. Creativity is a huge part of my life, whether it’s designing a website or drawing a new character.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Inspires Me</h3>
    <p>I’m really inspired by tech creators and innovators. People like **Mark Zuckerberg**, **Elon Musk**, and **Bill Gates** have shown me how technology can change the world and make a big impact. I hope that one day, I can build something that helps people, just like they have.</p>

    <h3>My Family's Inspiration</h3>
    <p>My family has been a huge source of support and inspiration throughout my life. My parents have always encouraged me to follow my passions, whether it’s coding, gaming, or anything else I’m interested in. They believe in me and push me to keep learning and growing, no matter how challenging things might get. My siblings are also amazing—they motivate me with their creativity and ideas, and we often work together on projects, sharing tips and helping each other out. Without their encouragement and love, I wouldn’t be where I am today!</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Learning & Growing:</strong> Every day, I strive to learn something new. Whether it's through online courses, books, or watching tutorials, I'm always working to improve my skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Building Projects:</strong> I want to keep building cool things like websites, apps, and games. I’m planning to start a YouTube channel soon to share my coding journey with others!</li>
        <li><strong>Helping Others:</strong> I love sharing what I know with my friends and classmates. I hope to inspire other young people to get into coding and technology, just like I was inspired when I first started.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
    <p>I’m always learning and looking for ways to improve my skills. I want to keep building websites, create my own apps, and maybe even start my own YouTube channel someday to share my knowledge with others. I think the possibilities are endless, and I’m super excited for the future.</p>

    <p>So, thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet! I hope you’ll follow along as I share more about what I’m up to, the things I’m learning, and maybe even some fun projects along the way.</p>

    <p>Feel free to leave a comment if you want to say hello or ask me questions—I’d love to hear from you!</p>

    <p>Until next time,bye</p>
